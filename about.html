            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I recently graduated the Diploma of Advanced Programming and am excited to take my first steps as a developer. I discovered that I really excel at solving problems and writing code, and I love to create new things.</p><br>
            <p>However, I've also worked in a variety of roles focusing on customer service and teaching. In 2017, I went to Japan and spent 4 years teaching English. I excelled at teaching and was promoted to a leadership position where I provided support to teachers and school staff at one of the largest schools in the district. I really enjoyed teaching as I could help my colleagues and clients meet their goals</p><br>
            <p>I returned to Australia in 2021, where I have worked in retail during peak Christmas season, as a temporary administrative assistant for the AEC as part of the 2022 Federal election, and currently I am teaching one-on-one business English lessons with German company Learnship.</p><br>
            <p>You can find my resume <a>here</a>. I'm also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-s-0a4141174/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
